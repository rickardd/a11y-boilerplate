## Navigation Vs. Menu Vs. Menubar

***Navigation***

***Menu***

A menu is a set of actions. e.g new, edit, delete, publish etc...

***W3C.org says***
A menu is a widget that offers a list of choices to the user, such as a set of actions or functions. A menu is usually opened, or made visible, by activating a menu button, choosing an item in a menu that opens a sub menu, or by invoking a command, such as Shift + F10 in Windows, that opens a context specific menu. When a user activates a choice in a menu, the menu usually closes unless the choice opened a submenu.

***Menubar***

A menu bar is often a horisontal list sitting at the top of the page. 

***W3C.org says***
A menu that is visually persistent is a menubar. A menubar is typically horizontal and is often used to create a menu bar similar to those found near the top of the window in many desktop applications, offering the user quick access to a consistent set of commands.
