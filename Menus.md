## Navigation Vs. Menu Vs. Menubar

***Navigation***

role-'navigation'

*Navigation landmarks provide a way to identify groups (e.g. lists) of links that are intended to be used for website or page content navigation.*

***Menu***

*role='menu'*

https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#menu

*A menu is a set of actions. e.g new, edit, delete, publish etc...*

***W3C.org says***
A menu is a widget that offers a list of choices to the user, such as a set of actions or functions. A menu is usually opened, or made visible, by activating a menu button, choosing an item in a menu that opens a sub menu, or by invoking a command, such as Shift + F10 in Windows, that opens a context specific menu. When a user activates a choice in a menu, the menu usually closes unless the choice opened a submenu.

***Menubar***

*role='menubar'*

https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/menubar/menubar-1/menubar-1.html

*A menu bar is often a horisontal list sitting at the top of the page.*

***W3C.org says***
A menu that is visually persistent is a menubar. A menubar is typically horizontal and is often used to create a menu bar similar to those found near the top of the window in many desktop applications, offering the user quick access to a consistent set of commands.
